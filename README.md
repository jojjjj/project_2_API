Project #2: The Zen {Gen}erator

Welcome to the Zen {Gen}erator!

There's a lot going on in the world these days... war, climate change, inflation, batshit politicians...

Not to mention the barage of information, memes, and bad news thrown at you on a daily basis.

Sometimes you just need to clear your mind and find your center again.

That's where Zen {Gen}erator comes in. With a click of a button, you'll read inspirational and calming words of wisdom from the world's finest: philosophers, inventors, scientists, religious figures, writers, etc etc.

Once you're feeling lighter, feel free to toggle the "Find Your Light" button to experience a new environment that matches your Zen.
